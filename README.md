Heisenberg
==========

This is a python program that evaluates the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian
matrix of the quantum Heisenberg model for spin chains. Then the Hamiltonian
matrix is diagonalized, and *eigenvalues* and *eigenvectors* are obtained. In
the last step, the Total Position Spread tensor is computed.

For the moments, it only works in open boundary conditions.
